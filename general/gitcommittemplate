# For the subject line:
#  * Use 50 characters maximum.
#  * Do not use sentence-ending period.
# 
# Subject line types (don't capitalize):
#  * feat: A new feature MINOR
#  * fix: A bugfix PATCH
#  * refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
#  * docs: Documentation only changes
#  * ci: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
#  * build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
#  * test: Changes that only have to do with testing
#
# Every commit has to be of one of these types, if the commit belongs to
# multiple types, it should be splitted into different commits, to
# enforce concise commits and to avoid "mass commits" like "fixed some
# bugs and added stuff" and to be able to comply with SemVer more
# easily.
#
#
# Scopes:
# 
# The scope of a commit should be the "unit" of the project that some
# changes are made to. For example in a java/Groovy/Kotlin Project, this
# could be the lower-most package.
#
# For the body text:
#  * Use as many lines as needed.
#  * Use 72 characters maximum per line for typical word wrap text.
